A silver whistle was protruding from under the mustache, and he was \\\\ncarrying a large wooden crate under one arm, his broomstick under the  other.  \\\\nHarry spun the speed dial on his Omnioculars back to normal, watching closely \\\\nas Mostafa mounted his broomstick and kicked the crate open - four balls burst \\\\ninto the air: the scarlet Quaffle, the two black Bludgers, and (Harry saw it for \\\\nthe brief est moment, before it sped out of sight) the minuscule, winged Golden \\\\nSnitch.  With a sharp blast on his whistle, Mostafa shot into the air after the \\\\nballs.  \\\\n\\u201cTheeeeeeeey\\u2019re OFF!\\u201d  screamed Bagman. \\u201cAnd it\\u2019s Mullet! Troy! Moran! \\\\nDimitrov! Back to Mullet! Tr oy! Levski! Moran!\\u201d  \\\\nIt was Quidditch as Harry had never seen it played before. He was pressing his \\\\nOmnioculars so hard to his glasses that they were cutting into the bridge of his \\\\nnose. The speed of the players was in credible - the Chasers were throwing t he \\\\nQuaffle to one another so fast that Bagman only had time to say their names.  \\\\nHarry spun the slow dial on the right of his Omnioculars again, pressed the \\\\nplay-by-play button on the top, and he was immediately watching in slow \\\\nmotion, while glittering pu rple lettering flashed across the lenses and the noise \\\\nof the crowd pounded against his eardrums.  \\\\nHAWKSHEAD ATTACKING FORMATION, he read as he watched the three \\\\nIrish Chasers zoom closely together, Troy in the center, slightly ahead of Mullet \\\\nand Moran, be aring down upon the Bul garians.  PORSKOFF PLOY flashed up \\\\nnext, as Troy made as though to dart upward with the Quaffle, drawing away \\\\nthe Bulgarian Chaser Ivanova and dropping the Quaffle to Moran.  One of the \\\\nBulgarian Beaters, Volkov, swung hard at a pas sing Bludger with his small \\\\nclub, knocking it into Moran\\u2019s path; Moran ducked to avoid the Bludger and \\\\ndropped the Quaffle; and Levski, soaring beneath, caught it - \\u201cTROY \\\\nSCORES!\\u201d roared Bagman, and the stadium shuddered with a roar of applause \\\\nand cheers.  \\u201cTen zero to Ireland!\\u201d'\\n 'two Bludgers, two Weasleys, and Chaser Bell, and speeds toward the -- \\\\nwait a moment -- was that the Snitch?\\\"  \\\\n \\\\nA murmur ran through the crowd as Adrian Pucey dropped the Quaffle,  \\\\ntoo \\\\nbusy looking over his shoulder at the flash of gold that had passed his  \\\\nleft ear.  \\\\n \\\\nHarry saw it. In a great rush of excitement he dived downward after the  \\\\nstreak of gold. Slytherin Seeker Terence Higgs had seen it, too. Neck  \\\\nand neck they hurtle d toward the Snitch -all the Chasers seemed to have  \\\\nforgotten what they were supposed to be doing as they hung in midair to  \\\\nwatch.  \\\\n \\\\nHarry was faster than Higgs -- he could see the little round ball, wings  \\\\nfluttering, darting up ahead - - he put on an extra spurt of speed -- \\\\n \\\\nWHAM! A roar of rage echoed from the Gryffindors below -- Marcus \\\\nFlint  \\\\nhad blocked Harry on purpose, and Harry\\\\'s broom spun off course, Harry  \\\\nholding on for dear life.  \\\\n \\\\n\\\"Foul!\\\" screamed the Gryffindors.  \\\\n \\\\nMadam Hooch spoke a ngrily to Flint and then ordered a free shot at the  \\\\ngoal posts for Gryffindor. But in all the confusion, of course, the  \\\\nGolden Snitch had disappeared from sight again.  \\\\n \\\\nDown in the stands, Dean Thomas was yelling, \\\"Send him off, ref! Red  \\\\ncard!\\\"  \\\\n \\\\n\\\"What are you talking about, Dean?\\\" said Ron.  \\\\n \\\\n\\\"Red card!\\\" said Dean furiously. \\\"In soccer you get shown the red card  \\\\nand you\\\\'re out of the game!\\\"'\\n '\\\"Three Chasers, one Keeper,\\\" said Harry, who was determined to \\\\nremember  \\\\nit all. \\\"And they play with the Quaffle. Okay, got that. So what are  \\\\nthey for?\\\" He pointed at  the three balls left inside the box.  \\\\n \\\\n\\\"I\\\\'ll show you now,\\\" said Wood. \\\"Take this.\\\"  \\\\n \\\\nHe handed Harry a small club, a bit like a short baseball bat.  \\\\n \\\\n\\\"I\\\\'m going to show you what the Bludgers do,\\\" Wood said. \\\"These two are  \\\\nthe Bludgers.\\\"  \\\\n \\\\nHe showed Harry two identical balls, jet black and slightly smaller than  \\\\nthe red Quaffle. Harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to  \\\\nescape the straps holding them inside the box.  \\\\n \\\\n\\\"Stand back,\\\" Wood warned Harry. He bent down and freed one of the  \\\\nBludge rs. \\\\n \\\\nAt once, the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at  \\\\nHarry\\\\'s face. Harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking  \\\\nhis nose, and sent it zigzagging away into the air -- it zoomed around  \\\\ntheir heads and then shot at Woo d, who dived on top of it and managed to  \\\\npin it to the ground.  \\\\n \\\\n\\\"See?\\\" Wood panted, forcing the struggling Bludger back into the crate  \\\\nand strapping it down safely. \\\"The Bludgers rocket around, trying to  \\\\nknock players off their brooms. That\\\\'s why you have two Beaters on each  \\\\nteam -- the Weasley twins are ours -- it\\\\'s their job to protect their  \\\\nside from the Bludgers and try and knock them toward the other team. So  \\\\n-- think you\\\\'ve got all that?\\\"  \\\\n \\\\n\\\"Three Chasers try and score with the Quaffle; the K eeper guards the  \\\\ngoal posts; the Beaters keep the Bludgers away from their team,\\\" Harry'\\n 'None of them spoke as they changed into their scarlet robes. Harry  \\\\nwondered if they were feeling like he was : as though he\\\\'d eaten  \\\\nsomething extremely wriggly for breakfast.

He  \\\\nthought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to  \\\\nlaugh.  \\\\n \\\\nThere was a horrible smell in the kitch en the next morning when Harry  \\\\nwent in for breakfast. It seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in  \\\\nthe sink. He went to have a look. The tub was full of what looked like  \\\\ndirty rags swimming in gray water.  \\\\n \\\\n\\\"What\\\\'s this?\\\" he asked Aunt Petunia. Her  lips tightened as they always  \\\\ndid if he dared to ask a question.  \\\\n \\\\n\\\"Your new school uniform,\\\" she said.  \\\\n \\\\nHarry looked in the bowl again.  \\\\n \\\\n\\\"Oh,\\\" he said, \\\"I didn\\\\'t realize it had to be so wet.\\\"  \\\\n \\\\n\\\"DotA be stupid,\\\" snapped Aunt Petunia. \\\"I\\\\'m dyeing s ome of Dudley\\\\'s \\\\nold \\\\nthings gray for you.

THE FIREBOLT HAS  \\\\nAN ACCELERAT ION OF 150 MILES AN HOUR IN TEN SECONDS \\\\nAND INCORPORATES AN  \\\\nUNBREAKABLE BRAKING CHARM. PRICE ON REQUEST.  \\\\n \\\\nPrice on request... Harry didn\\\\'t like to think how much gold the  \\\\nFirebolt would cost. He had never wanted anything as much in his whole  \\\\nlife -- but he  had never lost a Quidditch match on his Nim bus Two  \\\\nThousand, and what was the point in emptying his Gringotts vault for the  \\\\nFirebolt, when he had a very good broom already? Harry didn\\\\'t ask for  \\\\nthe price, but he returned, almost every day after that, jus t to look at  \\\\nthe Firebolt.  \\\\n \\\\nThere were, however, things that Harry needed to buy. He went to the  \\\\nApothecary to replenish his store of potions ingredients, and as his  \\\\nschool robes were now several inches too short in the arm and leg, he'\\n 'hurried down the front steps onto the grounds for their first flying  \\\\nlesson. It was a clear, breezy day, and the grass rippled under their  \\\\nfeet as they marched down the sloping lawns toward a smooth, flat lawn  \\\\non the opposite side of the grounds to the forbidden forest, whose trees  \\\\nwere swaying darkly in the distance.  \\\\n \\\\nThe Slytherins were already there, and so were twenty broomsticks lying  \\\\nin neat lines on the ground. Harry had heard Fred and George Weasley  \\\\ncomplain about the school brooms, saying that some of them started to  \\\\nvibrate if you flew too high, or always flew slightly to the left.  \\\\n \\\\nTheir teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived. She had short, gray hair, and  \\\\nyellow eyes like a hawk.  \\\\n \\\\n\\\"Well, what are you all waiting for?\\\" she barked. \\\"Everyone stand by a  \\\\nbroomstick. Come on, hurry up.\\\"  \\\\n \\\\nHarry glanced down at his br oom. It was old and some of the twigs stuck  \\\\nout at odd angles.  \\\\n \\\\n\\\"Stick out your right hand over your broom,\\\" called Madam Hooch at the  \\\\nfront, \\\"and say \\\\'Up!\\\"\\\\'  \\\\n \\\\n\\\"UPF everyone shouted.  \\\\n \\\\nHarry\\\\'s broom jumped into his hand at once, but it was one of the  few \\\\nthat did. Hermione Granger\\\\'s had simply rolled over on the ground, and  \\\\nNeville\\\\'s hadn\\\\'t moved at all. Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell  \\\\nwhen you were afraid, thought Harry; there was a quaver in Neville\\\\'s  \\\\nvoice that said only too clearly tha t he wanted to keep his feet on the  \\\\nground.  \\\\n \\\\nMadam Hooch then showed them how to mount their brooms without \\\\nsliding  \\\\noff the end, and walked up and down the rows correcting their grips.'\\n 'The Three Broomsticks was packed, mainly with Hogwarts stu dents enjoying \\\\ntheir free afternoon, but also with a variety of mag ical people Harry rarely saw \\\\nanywhere else. Harry supposed that as Hogsmeade was the only all -wizard \\\\nvillage in Brit ain, it was a bit of a haven for creatures like hags, who were not \\\\nas adept as wizards at disguising themselves.  \\\\nIt was very hard to move through crowds in the Invisibility Cloak, in case you \\\\naccidentally trod on someone, which tended to lead to awkward qu estions.  \\\\nHarry edged slowly toward a spare table in the corner while Hermione went to \\\\nbuy drinks.  On his way through the pub, Harry spotted Ron, who was sitting \\\\nwith Fred, George, and Lee Jordan.  Resisting the urge to give Ron a good hard \\\\npoke in the ba ck of the head, he finally reached the table and sat down at it.  \\\\nHermione joined him a moment later and slipped him a butter beer under his \\\\ncloak.  \\\\n\\u201cI look like such an idiot, sitting here on my own,\\u201d she mut tered. \\u201cLucky I \\\\nbrought something to do.\\u201d  \\\\nAnd sh e pulled out a notebook in which she had been keeping a record of \\\\nS.P.E.W. members.  Harry saw his and Ron\\u2019s names at the top of the very short \\\\nlist.  It seemed a long time ago that they had sat making up those predictions \\\\ntogether, and Hermione had turned  up and appointed them secretary and \\\\ntreasurer.  \\\\n\\u201cYou know, maybe I should try and get some of the villagers in volved in \\\\nS.P.E.W.,\\u201d Hermione said thoughtfully, looking around the pub.  \\\\n\\u201cYeah, right,\\u201d said Harry.  He took a swig of butterbeer under his cloak .  \\\\n\\u201cHermione, when are you going to give up on this spew stuff?\\u201d  \\\\n\\u201cWhen house -elves have decent wages and working conditions!\\u201d  she hissed \\\\nback. \\u201cYou know, I\\u2019m starting to think it\\u2019s time for more direct action.  I \\\\nwonder how you get into the school kitchen s?\\u201d \\\\n\\u201cNo idea, ask Fred and George,\\u201d said Harry.  \\\\nHermione lapsed into thoughtful silence, while Harry drank his butterbeer, \\\\nwatching the people in the pub.  All of them looked cheerful and relaxed.  Ernie \\\\nMacmillan and Hannah Abbot were swapping Chocolate F rog cards at a nearby \\\\ntable; both of them sporting Support Cedric Diggory! badges on their cloaks.  \\\\nRight over by the door he saw Cho and a large group of her Ravenclaw friends.  \\\\nShe wasn\\u2019t wearing a Cedric badge though. . . . This cheered up Harry very \\\\nslightly.  \\\\nWhat wouldn\\u2019t he have given to be one of these peophe, sitting around laughing \\\\nand talking, with nothing to worry about but homework?  He imagined how it'\\n 'showing one another their purcha ses ( \\\" it , s a lunascope, old boy -- \\\\nno more messing around with moon charts, see?\\\") or else discussing the  \\\\ncase of Sirius Black (\\\"personalty, I won\\\\'t let any of the children out  \\\\nalone until he\\\\'s back in Azkaban\\\"). Harry didn\\\\'t have to do his homework  \\\\nunder the blankets by flashlight anymore; now he could sit in the bright  \\\\nsunshine outside Florean Fortescue\\\\'s Ice Cream Parlor, finishing all his  \\\\nessays with occasional help from Florean Fortescue himself, who, apart  \\\\nfrom knowing a great deal about medieval witch burnings, gave Harry free  \\\\nsundaes every half an hour.  \\\\n \\\\nOnce Harry had refilled his money bag with gold Galleons, silver  \\\\nSickles, and bronze Knuts from his vault at Gringotts, he had to  \\\\nexercise a lot of self -control not to spend the whole lot at once . He \\\\nhad to keep reminding himself that he had five years to go at Hogwarts,  \\\\nand how it would feel to ask the Dursleys for money for spellbooks, to  \\\\nstop himself from buying a handsome set of solid gold Gobstones (a  \\\\nwizarding game rather like marbles, in wh ich the stones squirt a  \\\\nnasty -smelling liquid into the other player\\\\'s face when they lose a  \\\\npoint). He was sorely tempted, too, by the perfect, moving model of the  \\\\ngalaxy in a large glass ball, which would have meant he never had to  \\\\ntake another Astronomy lesson. But the thing that tested Harry\\\\'s  \\\\nresolution most appeared in his favorite shop, Quality Quidditch  \\\\nSupplies, a week after he\\\\'d arrived at the Leaky Cauldron.  \\\\n \\\\nCurious to know what the crowd in the shop was staring at, Harry edged  \\\\nhis way inside and  squeezed in among the excited witches and wizards  \\\\nuntil he glimpsed a newly erected podium, on which was mounted the \\\\nmost  \\\\nmagnificent broom he had ever seen in his life.  \\\\n \\\\n\\\"Just come out -- prototype --\\\" a square -jawed wizard was telling his  \\\\ncompanion.  \\\\n \\\\n\\\"It\\\\'s the fastest broom in the world, isn\\\\'t it, Dad?\\\" squeaked a boy  \\\\nyounger than Harry, who was swinging off his father\\\\'s arm.']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"answer\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"The Chudley Cannons' team colour is green.\",\n          \"Dittany is primarily used for healing wounds and injuries.\",\n          \"You could buy broomsticks at Quality Quidditch Supplies.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ground_truth\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Orange\",\n          \"Healing\",\n          \"Quality Quidditch Supplies\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
